<p>THEOREM: Fire represents the domain of a function.</p>
<ul>
<li>A function f is represented by Fire.</li>
<li>In order to chain functions together such that the output (co-domain) of one function becomes the input (domain) of another function, and in order for both inputs to be represented by the same element (i.e. the element that represents a domain), the only element which can represent the domain is Fire, because Fire(domain) -&gt; f(Fire) -&gt; Fire(co-domain/domain).</li>
</ul>
<p>THEOREM: Formula = Wood; values = Earth.</p>
<ul>
<li>If it’s possible to use deductive reasoning (Metal operation) to yield a formula from values such that the values are found by evaluating (reducing the number of states of, i.e. “-&gt; Fire -&gt;”) the formula, then the only possibility is that the formula = Wood and its values = Earth.</li>
<li>formula.values uses the property accessor method (formula-element &amp;&amp; values(Earth)) and Formula.fromValues(values) uses the operation method (Wood-op(Values element)) because it is a function.</li>
<li>Compare this theorem with element-of (Earth op) vs. set-of (Wood op).</li>

<li>Prove: Metal = max(masses of moons of planet N)</li>
<li>Max is the only Fire function which maps collection -&gt; number.</li>
<li>Therefore, by the EOF, Metal = Max(Metal). This automatically forms a sequence.</li>
<li>If Metal is not a function of N, which is the case if Metal is a constant and the EOF applies, then the EOF states that Metal must be forced into a sequence (i.e. the reverse of the elements-of operation would be used). This requires an additional step, thereby being less efficient in terms of the EOF.</li>

<li>set-of(Wood op) Fire = Earth</li>
<li>Metal-set -&gt; Earth op -&gt; Fire-set</li>
<li>The only Earth operation which maps collection -&gt; collection is the intersection(&amp;&amp;) operation</li>
<li>units-of elements-of each collection must be the same.</li>
<li>Therefore, Earth = Metal &amp;&amp; Wood</li>
<li>Because of EOF, Metal (because it can be) must be masses-of moons-of planets.</li>
<li>Wood is already a set (it must be to be an operand of the &amp;&amp; operation), and Metal is a set.</li>
<li>Metal -&gt; Water op -&gt; Wood.</li>
<li>The only Water operation which results in a set is the “not” operation.</li>
<li>Therefore, Wood = not(Metal).</li>
<li>Since x &amp;&amp; not-x is the null set, and taking the average of the null set is impossible, the EOF states that the transition from Metal -&gt; Metal is given by Fire-op(Metal).</li>
<li>The only Fire operation which maps set -&gt; (number | set), such that (number | set) is the input to the “not” operation, is the “max” operation.</li>
<li>Therefore, Earth = max(masses of moons of planet N) &amp;&amp; not(max(masses of moons of planet N)).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Prove: Wood denominator = Mass of Earth’s moon</li>
<li>If the Wood in the numerator equals the Wood in the denominator, the EOF states that the expression ought to be x/y + 1. Since this is not the case, they cannot be equal.</li>
<li>The next possibility in line is forcing Wood to be a sequence by taking elements-of(Earth op) Wood = Water.</li>
<li>By the EOF, the elements of the Wood sequence are constant (if possible).</li>
<li>Since Water must be a function of the masses of a planet’s moons, and (x = Earth | Fire | Wood) &amp;&amp; mass(Wood) = Water, we have to consider each possibility.</li>
<li>Since Earth = moons-of(Water = Mercury), and Mercury has no moons, x cannot = Earth.</li>
<li>Since Fire = moons-of(Metal = Venus), and Venus has no moons, x cannot be Fire.</li>
<li>Since Wood = moons-of(Earth = planet Earth), and planet Earth has exactly one moon, x must be Wood.</li>
<li>Therefore, the Wood denominator = a sequence with all elements being the mass of planet Earth’s moon. [_]</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Prove: Wood = 10^16 kg</li>
<li>Let x be a rounded number, as in 10^(elof N) * x = elof N. (Because must be able to be equal to by EOF)</li>
<li>Therefore, x = Water.</li>
<li>Constant = Earth.</li>
<li>Transforming a constant into a rounded number = (Earth -&gt; Metal op -&gt; Water).</li>
<li>Therefore, Wood = Metal(a, b?).</li>
<li>The only Metal operation which transforms number(constant) -&gt; number(x) is “^”.</li>
<li>Therefore, Wood = a^b.</li>
<li>Both a and b must have no units, therefore their units must be equal, and also equal to the units of Wood.</li>
<li>Therefore, Wood = Fire ^ Metal</li>
<li>Max must be used. Since Fire is determined first, there is no a priori limitation on Fire, therefore it must be 10. Since Metal must have no units, this must be enforced by taking Metal(that which has effective units) -&gt; Fire op -&gt; Water(target units = no units).</li>
<li>Because max must be used, Fire = 10 and Water = 6. Therefore, Metal = 16.</li>
<li>Therefore, Wood = 10^16, and Metal &gt;= 10^16 (&gt;= so that rounded numbers like 1.0000001 -&gt; 1.00(0) can be accounted for as belonging to the appropriate set with the condition &gt;= 1, for example).</li>

<ul>
<li>Prove: Wood = (-1)^(N+1)</li>
<li>Wood = Fire ^ Metal</li>
<li>Because Wood must be a sequence: elof Wood_i = Earth.</li>
<li>Because These elements must have no units, Earth(effective units) -&gt; Metal op -&gt; Water(target units = no units).</li>
<li>The only Metal op which maps number (input is number) -&gt; number is “^”</li>
<li>Therefore, Wood = a ^ b.</li>
<li>units(a) = units(b) and units(a &amp;&amp; b) = units(a ^ b) = no units</li>
<li>Therefore, Wood = Fire ^ Metal.</li>
<li>Since there is no need for units on the planets or their properties, the function is from the index representation of the planets.</li>
<li>elof result(Wood) = Fire. elof input({0..4})(Fire) = Earth. Earth -&gt; Water op -&gt; Fire.</li>
<li>Therefore, Wood = f(Water op).</li>
<li>What is the Water op? How do we yield Water from index {0..4}.</li>
<li>The simplest way to transform {0..4} -&gt; Water is by Metal op. Since there is no unary Metal operation, and since we seek to transform {0..4} -&gt; Water, {0..4}(Fire) ^(Metal op) 0(Fire) = Water.</li>
<li>Since Water -&gt; Fire op -&gt; Metal, and the only way to yield Metal from Water using a Fire op is if Fire = addition (unary keeps the element the same), and since adding sequences requires that the sequences have the same size, and since the Fire sequence {0..4} does indeed have the same size as {1,1,1,1,1}: Metal = {0..4} + {1,1,1,1,1} = {1..5}. Addition works like adding vectors.</li>
<li>Water -&gt; Wood op -&gt; Fire, but there is no Wood op which maps sequence(i.e. Water) -&gt; sequence(i.e. Fire).</li>
<li>The next option is to try elements of the sequences. Since Water is already a function of an index (i.e. {0..4}), elof(Wood op) Water = Wood.</li>
<li>elof(Wood op) Fire_i(Earth) = Metal.</li>
<li>Wood -&gt; Water op -&gt; Metal.</li>
<li>Water-op(elof Water) = Earth; and sequence-of(Earth op) Earth = Fire. (1)</li>
<li>Because (1) is possible, the Water op must be performed on Water to yield Fire.</li>
<li>The result as elements of a sequence is Earth, and Earth = f(x) (result of a unary operation), therefore the Water operation must be a unary operation.</li>
<li>The only non-trivial unary Water operation (1^(-1) = 1) which maps number -&gt; number is the additive inverse operation.</li>
<li>Therefore, Fire = {-1, -1, -1, -1, -1}.</li>
<li>Furthermore, Wood = {-1, 1, -1, 1, -1}.</li>

<ul>
<li>Prove: Metal = 10^13 MeV/c^2</li>
<li>Metal(that which has effective units) -&gt; Metal op -&gt; Metal(that which has target units).</li>
<li>The only Metal operation which maps number -&gt; number is “^”.</li>
<li>Therefore, Metal = a ^ b.</li>
<li>units(a) &amp;&amp; units(b) = units(that which has no units).</li>
<li>Therefore, a &amp;&amp; b = Water.</li>
<li>Furthermore, either a or b = Wood.</li>
<li>If a = Wood, b = either Fire or Earth.</li>
<li>Because the units of Metal are the correct units, Metal must be a scalar.</li>
<li>elof/scalarof(Wood op) planets-index(Fire) = Earth.</li>
<li>Fire -&gt; Water op -&gt; Earth</li>
<li>The only Water op which maps sequence to scalar is size-of.</li>
<li>size-of Fire = Metal = 5.</li>
<li>Metal -&gt; Wood op -&gt; Earth. However, Wood-op(Metal) = Water =/= Earth, and Metal / x = Earth does not hold for any x.</li>
<li>Therefore, by the EOF, b = Fire.</li>
<li>Furthermore, Metal -&gt; Earth op -&gt; Fire</li>
<li>Since it is possible to reach Fire from Metal in a single Earth operation (binary multiplication), the EOF states binary multiplication must be used (as opposed, for example, to a composite operation involving unary squaring of Metal).</li>
<li>Therefore, Fire = 5(Metal) * Earth(2) = 10(Fire).</li>
<li>Furthermore, Metal = 10^Wood.</li>
<li>Since Wood &gt; Fire, and there are infinite possibilities of Wood which are &gt; 10(Fire), we must use the minimum of these possibilities represented by Wood (13).</li>
<li>Therefore, Metal = 10^13 MeV/c^2</li>
